##  Hello 🖐🏽, this is Aruu☆'s GitHub page.

My name is real Matthew Arni Bendo, and I am 21 years old. I am single. I am a student at [Samar State University](ssu.edu.ph), and I return home by 8 PM at the latest every day. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink alcohol. I go to bed at 10 PM and make sure to get at least eight hours of sleep no matter what. Drinking a glass of warm milk and doing about 20 minutes of stretching before bed usually helps me sleep soundly until morning. I wake up feeling refreshed and stress-free, like a baby. My last health checkup showed no particular problems. <br><br>
What I want to convey is that I am someone who wants to live a very peaceful life. I try to avoid getting involved in competitive situations or conflicts that would keep me awake at night. That's how I approach society, and I believe it brings me happiness. However, if I were to be forced into a fight, I wouldn't intend to lose to anyone.

## For more detailed information about me, please see this Interests section.
