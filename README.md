<h1 align="center">Hello, I am <a href="https://github.com/Aru-gxtx">Aru</a>!</h1>

<h3 align="center">Welcome to my GitHub profilee</h3>

<p align="center">My real name is Matthew Arni Bendo. Iâ€™m 20 years old. And I am not married. I still study as a Computer Engineering, and I get have free time every day by 8:00 PM at the latest. I donâ€™t smoke, but I occasionally drink. Iâ€™m in bed by 10:00 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.</p>

<p align="center">Iâ€™m trying to explain that Iâ€™m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldnâ€™t lose to anyone.</p>
